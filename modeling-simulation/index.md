DynamX Consulting has a strong history of Modeling and Simulation (M&S) performance. Starting in 2005, DynamX Consulting has been increasingly engaged in the Modeling and Simulation trade-space performing tasks in areas such as:

 - Course development and delivery
 - Model development to include mathematical models as well as discrete event modeling
 - M&S return on investment analysis for the DoD
 - Development and research of innovative ROI techniques
 - Analysis of Medical M&S return on investment
 - Industrial Supply Chain Analysis

Additionally, DynamX consulting has been very involved in the business practice of Modeling and Simulation serving on or leading business practice committees in the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO) and the [National Modeling and Simulation Coalition][nmsc] (NMSC).  Recently, DynamX Consulting authored a paper, ["Calculating Return on Investment for US Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation"][1] in conjunction with other leading researchers which was selected as the 2011 Defense Acquisition University Research Paper of the Year.  An addendum, ["Current Trends in M&S ROI Calculation"][2] has also been made available.
