In 2007 DynamX Consulting developed a one of a kind course to help analysts prepare for deployment to the operational theater. The course, entitled “Quick Turn Analysis” was designed to enable analysts to process data and produce reports/charts in minimum time. Utilizing Microsoft Office VBA, it teaches AF analysts to automate data collection and analysis processes that are extremely time consuming to perform by hand. The course has received critical acclaim from students, from supervisors of these students in the theater, and from the Office of Studies and Analysis of the Secretary of the Air Force.

DynamX also offers beginning to advanced Microsoft Excel classes designed to fit your needs.  Whether it is cost analysis, data reduction, or data presentation, DynamX can help you find a solution. Courses can be anywhere from one day to two weeks in length. [Email us](mailto:{{ site.email }}) today for a free consultation.
